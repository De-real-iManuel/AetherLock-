## 🌌 Overview

**AetherLock** is a next-generation AI-driven escrow protocol built on Solana, designed to revolutionize trustless transactions through intelligent automation and zero-knowledge privacy.

AetherLock is a multi-layer protocol that enables autonomous escrow and task verification across Web3 ecosystems. It integrates Solana smart contracts, ZetaChain's cross-chain verification, and zkMe's zero-knowledge KYC with AI-powered agents that act as unbiased digital mediators.

AetherLock provides the missing link between trust, automation, and privacy — allowing users to transact, verify, and resolve disputes without intermediaries.

## 🚀 Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Agentic Escrow** | AI-powered escrow that releases funds based on verified task completion |
| **Zero-Knowledge KYC** | zkMe integration ensures compliance without exposing user data |
| **AI Verification Agents** | Off-chain models analyze submitted evidence and sign results cryptographically |
| **Dispute Resolution** | Built-in time-bound dispute process with admin fallback |
| **Cross-chain Proof Validation** | Uses ZetaChain to validate zk proofs across multiple chains |
| **Decentralized Evidence Storage** | IPFS for transparent, immutable, and privacy-preserving evidence logs |

**Key Features (from Docs)**:
* AI-Powered Verification: AWS Bedrock Claude integration for intelligent task validation
* Zero-Knowledge KYC: Privacy-preserving identity verification via zkMe on ZetaChain
* Multi-Chain Architecture: Solana MVP with planned expansion to other chains
* IPFS Evidence Storage: Decentralized storage for dispute resolution materials
* Cyberpunk Dashboard: Immersive React interface with Framer Motion animations

## 🏗️ Architecture

AetherLock is a multi-chain escrow protocol that combines Solana's fast transaction processing with Zeta Chain's zero-knowledge capabilities and AI-powered verification. The system creates a trustless environment where AI agents act as objective arbiters for task completion verification.
