# AetherLock Protocol Requirements

## Introduction

AetherLock is an AI-driven, agentic escrow and P2P protocol that enables secure, automated transactions with AI-powered verification. The system combines blockchain technology (Solana), zero-knowledge KYC (zkMe on Zeta Chain), and AI agents to create a trustless escrow service for the Web3 ecosystem.

## Glossary

- **AetherLock_System**: The complete escrow protocol including smart contracts, AI agents, and frontend interface
- **Escrow_Contract**: Solana-based smart contract that holds funds and manages release/refund logic
- **AI_Agent**: Off-chain verification service that validates task completion and signs verification messages
- **zkMe_Service**: Zero-knowledge KYC provider operating on Zeta Chain testnet
- **Protocol_Treasury**: System wallet that collects 2% fees from successful escrow releases
- **Verification_Oracle**: Service that relays AI agent signatures to the blockchain
- **Dispute_Window**: 24-48 hour period for raising disputes before automatic resolution
- **ZetaChain_Gateway**: Universal blockchain gateway enabling cross-chain message passing and state synchronization
- **Universal_App**: ZetaChain application that operates across multiple blockchain ecosystems (Solana, Sui, TON)
- **Omnichain_Message**: Cross-chain communication protocol for broadcasting escrow state updates

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Escrow Creation and Fund Management

**User Story:** As a buyer, I want to create an escrow with locked funds, so that I can ensure secure P2P transactions with AI verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a buyer initiates escrow creation, THE Escrow_Contract SHALL create a new escrow account with buyer, seller, amount, and expiry parameters
2. WHEN a buyer deposits funds, THE Escrow_Contract SHALL transfer tokens from buyer wallet to escrow PDA and mark escrow as funded
3. THE Protocol_Treasury SHALL receive 2% of the escrow amount upon successful fund release
4. WHEN expiry timestamp is reached without resolution, THE Escrow_Contract SHALL enable automatic refund to buyer
5. WHERE third-party wallet authorization is required, THE Escrow_Contract SHALL verify wallet signature before accepting deposits

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Verification System

**User Story:** As a protocol user, I want AI agents to verify task completion automatically, so that escrow releases are based on objective validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN task verification is requested, THE AI_Agent SHALL analyze provided evidence and generate a boolean result with evidence hash
2. THE AI_Agent SHALL sign verification payload using Ed25519 private key with escrow_id, result, evidence_hash, and timestamp
3. WHEN verification signature is submitted, THE Escrow_Contract SHALL verify AI_Agent public key and signature validity
4. IF verification result is true, THEN THE Escrow_Contract SHALL release funds to seller minus protocol fee
5. IF verification result is false, THEN THE Escrow_Contract SHALL enable refund to buyer

### Requirement 3: Zero-Knowledge KYC Integration

**User Story:** As a protocol user, I want to complete KYC verification using zkMe, so that I can participate in escrows while maintaining privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates KYC verification, THE zkMe_Service SHALL provide zero-knowledge proof generation interface
2. THE zkMe_Service SHALL generate proof hash and store credential on Zeta Chain testnet
3. WHEN KYC proof is generated, THE AetherLock_System SHALL store proof hash reference for escrow eligibility
4. THE AetherLock_System SHALL validate KYC proof status before allowing escrow participation
5. WHERE KYC verification fails, THE AetherLock_System SHALL prevent escrow creation until valid proof is provided

### Requirement 4: Dispute Resolution System

**User Story:** As an escrow participant, I want to raise disputes when verification is incorrect, so that I have recourse for unfair outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dispute is raised, THE Escrow_Contract SHALL mark escrow as disputed and pause automatic resolution
2. THE Dispute_Window SHALL remain open for 24-48 hours after dispute initiation
3. WHILE escrow is disputed, THE Escrow_Contract SHALL prevent fund release or refund until resolution
4. WHERE manual arbitration is required, THE AetherLock_System SHALL enable admin resolution with buyer or seller outcome
5. WHEN dispute window expires without resolution, THE Escrow_Contract SHALL execute fallback logic based on original verification

### Requirement 5: Frontend Dashboard and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want a mobile-first dashboard to manage my escrows and wallet connections, so that I can easily interact with the protocol.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AetherLock_System SHALL provide wallet connection interface supporting Phantom, Solflare, and WalletConnect
2. THE AetherLock_System SHALL display user balance, locked funds, active escrows,profile for KYC and dispute status in dashboard
3. WHEN creating new escrow, THE AetherLock_System SHALL provide form interface with amount, seller address, and task description
4. THE AetherLock_System SHALL show real-time escrow status including AI verification progress and dispute options
5. WHERE mobile device is used, THE AetherLock_System SHALL provide responsive dark theme interface with neon accent colors

### Requirement 6: Evidence Storage and Verification

**User Story:** As a protocol participant, I want evidence to be stored securely and referenced on-chain, so that verification is transparent and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evidence is uploaded, THE AetherLock_System SHALL store files on IPFS and generate content hash
2. THE AI_Agent SHALL reference IPFS hash in verification payload for evidence traceability
3. THE Escrow_Contract SHALL store evidence hash on-chain for permanent record
4. WHERE evidence is disputed, THE AetherLock_System SHALL enable evidence review through IPFS hash lookup
5. THE AetherLock_System SHALL ensure no personally identifiable information is stored on-chain, only proof hashes

### Requirement 7: ZetaChain Universal Integration (Cross-Chain Escrow)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AetherLock to run as a ZetaChain Universal App, so that escrows and zkKYC verifications can execute seamlessly across multiple blockchains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AetherLock_System SHALL import and use ZetaChain_Gateway and Universal NFT interfaces for cross-chain logic
2. THE Escrow_Contract SHALL include onCall, onRevert, and onAbort functions to handle universal transaction flows
3. WHEN an escrow is created on Solana, THE ZetaChain_Gateway SHALL broadcast cross-chain state to Sui/TON via Omnichain_Message passing
4. WHEN AI verification or KYC proof occurs on another chain, THE ZetaChain_Gateway SHALL update escrow status universally
5. THE zkMe_Service SHALL generate and store zkKYC proofs on ZetaChain testnet to enable identity verification across all connected chains
6. THE AetherLock_System SHALL visualize chain connectivity and display verification flow for transparency
7. THE Universal_App SHALL be deployable and testable on ZetaChain Testnet for demonstration and hackathon validation
8. THE AetherLock_System SHALL produce logs for onCall, onRevert, and onAbort executions for traceability and bounty compliance
