### Week 2 (Nov 11-17): AI Integration & zkMe KYC
**Priority: Complete the AI verification and KYC flows**

**Days 1-3: Complete Smart Contract**
- ✅ Implement `submit_verification` with signature validation
- ✅ Add `release_funds` and `refund_buyer` with 2% fee calculation
- ✅ Build dispute system (`raise_dispute`, `resolve_dispute`)
- ✅ Comprehensive smart contract testing

**Days 4-5: zkMe Integration**
- ✅ Set up zkMe SDK for Zeta Chain testnet
- ✅ Implement KYC verification flow in frontend
- ✅ Store proof hashes and validate KYC status
- ✅ Test complete KYC → escrow creation flow

**Days 6-7: AI Agent Enhancement**
- ✅ Improve AI verification logic with better evidence analysis
- ✅ Add deterministic scoring and confidence metrics
- ✅ Implement signed verification submission to smart contract
- ✅ Test end-to-end: evidence → AI analysis → blockchain verification

**Week 2 Deliverable:** Complete functional flow: KYC → Create Escrow → AI Verify → Release Funds

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

**Week 1 Risks:**
- Solana development environment issues → Have backup devnet RPC endpoints
- Smart contract complexity → Start with minimal viable contract, add features incrementally

**Week 2 Risks:**
- zkMe integration challenges → Have fallback mock KYC for demo if needed
- AI agent reliability → Implement deterministic fallback responses

**Week 3 Risks:**
- Animation performance issues → Progressive enhancement approach, fallback to simpler animations
- Three.js complexity → Use proven libraries and examples, avoid custom shaders initially

**Week 4 Risks:**
- Last-minute bugs → Feature freeze by Day 5, only critical fixes after
- Demo environment issues → Multiple deployment environments and backup plans

## 🏆 Competitive Advantages

1. **Visual Excellence:** Most hackathon projects have basic UIs - our cyberpunk design will stand out
2. **Technical Depth:** Full-stack Web3 + AI integration with multiple chains
3. **Real Functionality:** Not just a prototype - actually works end-to-end
4. **Innovation:** Novel combination of AI agents, zkKYC, and escrow automation
5. **Demo Impact:** Cinematic presentation with smooth animations and sound effects

**Target: Top 3 finish with potential for overall winner based on technical innovation + visual impact**
