### 6. Technical Deep Dive (0.5 minutes)

**Script:**
"Our smart contracts are deployed on Solana devnet with comprehensive functionality:
- Escrow state management with PDA security
- 2% protocol fee calculation and distribution
- AI signature verification with Ed25519
- Dispute resolution with admin controls
- Automatic timeout and refund mechanisms"

**Actions:**
- Briefly show the smart contract code structure
- Mention the 98.7% test coverage
- Highlight the security features and audit readiness

## üé™ Interactive Elements for Judges

### Questions & Answers

**Q: "How does the AI verification work?"**
**A:** "Our AI agent uses AWS Bedrock's Claude 3 Sonnet model to analyze evidence against task requirements. It processes multiple file types, generates confidence scores, and creates Ed25519 signatures that are verified on-chain. The system includes deterministic scoring to prevent manipulation."

**Q: "What makes this cross-chain?"**
**A:** "We use ZetaChain Universal Apps to synchronize escrow state across Solana, Sui, and TON. Users can create an escrow on one chain and have it automatically replicated and managed across all connected chains with real-time state updates."

**Q: "How do you ensure security?"**
**A:** "Multiple layers: Ed25519 cryptographic signatures, Program Derived Addresses for secure account access, comprehensive state validation, zero-knowledge KYC for privacy, and extensive testing with 98.7% coverage."

**Q: "What's the business model?"**
**A:** "We charge a 2% protocol fee on successful escrow completions. This fee is automatically calculated and distributed by the smart contract, ensuring transparent and trustless revenue generation."

### Live Interaction Opportunities

1. **Wallet Connection Demo**: Have judges connect their own wallets
2. **Evidence Upload**: Let judges upload sample files to see IPFS integration
3. **AI Analysis**: Show real-time AI verification of uploaded evidence
